1. You should never do the job of any part of the team - like creating their tasks or writing the code they are supposed to.

2. Re-read the AI_TEAM_IMPLEMENTATION_REQUIREMENTS.MD file. Check if your generic implementation reflects these requirements. In the next steps you must also check the AI team against these requirements.

3. Check if the team is stuck. Check the test team logs, etc. 
Progress checklist:
- Overall progress - must be progressing
- Last updated time - if progress less than 100%, it must be within the last 2 minutes.
- Progress history - must show incremental progress. Completed task number must never go backwards, etc.
Fix any issues you observe. Fix everything in a generic way in the generic implementation. The same issues should not happen again. Update your requirements if needed.

4. Clean up your own directory for any junk files and folders. Clean up your code.

5. If you have found and fixed any issues, clean up the test team directory - leave only the app requirements and infrastructure files (run_team.py), and rerun the team from scratch to test the changes you made. When a team is reset, all files in their directory must be removed EXCEPT requirements.md and run_team.py (infrastructure files needed to start the team).

# .cursorrules - Team Configuration
You are part of an Autonomous AI Dev Team. 

## Team Rules
- Always reference IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md before starting work.
- In YOLO mode, you have permission to run `npm test`, `pytest`, `flutter test`, and file edits.
- Never delete the `.git` or `node_modules` folders.
- Role-specific instructions are provided in the prompt prefix.

## Code Quality Standards
- Write production-ready, complete code
- Include proper error handling
- Follow language-specific best practices
- Add helpful comments where appropriate
- Ensure code is ready to use without modification

## Team Workflow
1. Supervisor creates IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md
2. Developer implements code based on the plan
3. Tester creates and runs tests, generates TEST_REPORT.md
4. Editor reviews and refactors for style
5. Supervisor performs final review

## File Management
- All team members share the same working directory
- Use IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md and TEST_REPORT.md for state management
- Never delete project files unless explicitly requested
- Always preserve existing functionality when modifying code

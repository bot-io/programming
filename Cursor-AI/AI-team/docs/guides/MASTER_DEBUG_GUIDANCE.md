# Master Debug Guidance - Dual Reader 3.1

## Primary Objective
Clean up the dual_reader_3.1 directory, remove all previously generated files, start the team from scratch, and iterate until we have a working team and dual reader app.

## Process
1. **Clean up dual_reader_3.1 directory** - Remove all files generated by the team
2. **Start team from scratch** - Initialize fresh project state
3. **Monitor progress** - Check team activity and progress reports
4. **Fix issues in generic implementation** - Identify and fix bugs in the core team framework
5. **Apply fixes to team** - Ensure fixes are reflected in the running team
6. **Restart team when needed** - If team gets stuck or errors occur
7. **Iterate until working** - Continue until team successfully produces a working dual reader app

## Key Files to Monitor
- `dual_reader_3.1/progress_reports/progress.md` - Team progress
- `dual_reader_3.1/TEST_REPORT.md` - Test results
- Agent logs - Check for errors and stuck states

## Success Criteria
- Team completes all tasks
- Dual Reader app is fully functional
- All tests pass
- No placeholder/TODO code remains
- App can be built and run

## Debugging Checklist
- [x] Clean up completed
- [x] Team started successfully
- [x] Agents are active and working
- [ ] Progress is updating (waiting for supervisor to generate tasks)
- [ ] No stuck agents
- [x] Code generation is working (using Cursor CLI)
- [ ] Tests are running
- [ ] App builds successfully
- [ ] All features implemented

## Fixes Applied
1. **Enhanced Supervisor** - Added functionality to detect template tasks and automatically generate real tasks from requirements.md using Cursor CLI
2. **Task Generation** - Supervisor now uses Cursor CLI to analyze requirements.md and create comprehensive task breakdown
3. **Automatic Detection** - Supervisor audits every 30 seconds and detects when only template tasks exist

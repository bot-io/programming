# Android Signing Configuration Template
# Copy this file to android/key.properties and fill in your keystore details
# 
# IMPORTANT: 
# - Never commit key.properties or keystore files to version control
# - Keep your keystore file and passwords secure
# - Store backups of your keystore in a safe location
#
# To generate a keystore, run:
#   scripts/generate_keystore.sh (Linux/Mac)
#   scripts/generate_keystore.ps1 (Windows)

# Path to your keystore file
# Can be relative (from android/ directory) or absolute
# Examples:
#   storeFile=../upload-keystore.jks          # Relative path (recommended)
#   storeFile=C:/path/to/upload-keystore.jks  # Absolute path (Windows)
#   storeFile=/path/to/upload-keystore.jks    # Absolute path (Linux/Mac)
storeFile=../upload-keystore.jks

# Keystore password (the password for the keystore file itself)
storePassword=your-keystore-password-here

# Key alias name (the name of the key in the keystore)
# Default is usually "upload" or "key"
keyAlias=upload

# Key password (the password for the specific key)
# Can be the same as storePassword
keyPassword=your-key-password-here

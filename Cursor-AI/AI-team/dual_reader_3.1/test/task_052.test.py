Your query was cut off. As Tester, I can:

**Immediate actions:**
1. Run the test suite and report results
2. Create platform-specific tests (Android/iOS/Web)
3. Create accessibility tests (screen reader, keyboard navigation, high contrast)
4. Expand E2E tests
5. Expand performance tests
6. Generate a coverage report and identify gaps

**Current priorities (from action plan):**
- Execute test suite (verify all tests pass)
- Create platform-specific test suites (critical gap — 0% coverage)
- Add accessibility tests (critical gap — 0% coverage)
- Expand E2E test coverage (from 30% to 50%)

Which should I prioritize? If you prefer, I can start by:
- Running the test suite to check current status
- Creating the platform-specific test structure
- Creating the accessibility test suite

What would you like me to focus on?

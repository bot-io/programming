## Tester status report

**Current test suite status:**
- Test files: 35+ test files across multiple categories
- Overall coverage: ~70%
- Recent improvements: Integration and error handling tests implemented

**Immediate priorities (from action plan):**
1. Execute test suite — verify all tests pass
2. Generate coverage report — identify gaps
3. Platform-specific tests — 0% coverage (critical gap)
4. Accessibility tests — 0% coverage (critical gap)

**What would you like me to focus on?**

1. Run the full test suite and report results
2. Generate and analyze coverage reports
3. Create platform-specific test suites (Android/iOS/Web)
4. Create accessibility test suites
5. Expand E2E test coverage
6. Review and fix any failing tests
7. Something else specific

Which should I prioritize?
